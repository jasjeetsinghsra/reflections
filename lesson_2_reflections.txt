What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you intialize a repositary using git init command, it creates 
	ahidden .git folder in that directory. Now we can use all the
	features of git withinin that  directory, and have version control 
	on our files within that directory and the sub directories within it.
